- Idea and coding was base on my enhanced Youtube Link Handler LB2 extension

what this extension do ?  
Pass a Twitch Clip link to extension (and your Auth Token too),
and it will return 3 global variable for you.
1. Extract Twitch Clip's ClipID from link
2. Return "Left Over" duration in milliseconds
   - if t= params not detect in url link, return full video duration.
   - if t= params is detected in url link,  return "Left Over" duration by using full video length minus starting second from t= params.
3. Return "Valid" flag base on extension successful process the given link or not
   
enable Debug if extension is not function correctly for view more info
